## Sonar the game

This is a simple game, written in JavaScript. The game idea was taken from book "Invent Your Own Computer Games with Python" by Albert Sweigart ( https://inventwithpython.com/chapter13.html ).

It works with javascript canvas object and is designed using an ASCII interface, found in classical roguelikes.

### Rules

Drop sonar onto treasure to collect it. Once you have collected the treasure, other sonar devices will update their displayed values to show the actual distance to treasure.
